# Vaccine Misinformaton Ontology (VAXMO)

The Vaccine Misinformation Ontology (VAXMO) describes concepts of vaccine misinformation using the Misinformation Ontology framework (Zhou and Zhang, 2007, 2004) and the nanopublication framework (nanopub.org). This ontology can be used to catalogue and analyze vaccine misinformation and be used in ontology-driven software tools. Details about this ontology and some sample use cases can be found in our published work below.

For the stripped down Misinformation Ontology, visit https://github.com/UTHealth-Ontology/MO where we recreated the original Misinformation Ontology for the purpose of this work.
